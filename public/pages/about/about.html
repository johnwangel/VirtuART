  <p class="description">InvisiARt is our ambitious attempt to provide a commity-generated art canvas through the cutting-edge technology of Aumented Reality. It was created as a final project for the DevLeague bootcamp in Oahu, Hawaii.</p>
  <p class="description">Our original inspiration was Pow!Wow!, Honolulu's annual street art festival in Kakaako, during which artists create and present murals painted on the walls of warehouses.</p>
  <p class="description">Our app enables "virtual graffiti" - a wall of art that anyone can contribute to from their mobile device and see projected virtually onto any "surface" through Augmented Reality, using the device's camera and special markers.</p>
