<h1>OUR APP</h1>
<p>InvisiARt was created as a final project for the DevLeague bootcamp in Oahu, Hawaii. It is our ambitious attempt to provide a commity-generated art canvas through the cutting-edge technology of Aumented Reality.</p>
<p>Our original inspiration was Pow!Wow! &mdash; Honolulu's annual street art festival in Kakaako, during which artists create and present murals painted on the walls of warehouses.</p>
<p>Our application enables "virtual graffiti" &mdash;  a wall of art that anyone can contribute to from their mobile device and see projected virtually onto any "surface" through Augmented Reality, using the device's camera and special markers.</p>
