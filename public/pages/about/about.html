  <p class="description">InvisiARt is our ambitious attempt to provide a commity-generated art canvas through the cutting-edge technology of Aumented Reality. It was created as a final project for the DevLeague bootcamp in Oahu, Hawaii.</p>
  <p class="description">Our inspiration was Pow!Wow!, the annual street art festival in Kakaako, where artists create and present murals painted on the walls in Honolulu's warehouse district.</p>
  <p class="description">InvisiARt enables "virtual graffiti" - a wall of art that anyone can contribute to from their mobile device and see projected virtually onto any "surface" through Augmented Reality. Just point your device's camera at one of our special markers, and any space becomes an instant art gallery! See <a href="/howtouse">How to Use</a> for more info.</p>

    <p class="description">Aloha! I moved to Hawaii from the blisteringly cold midwest state of Wisconsin nine years ago and now I can never go back! Iâ€™m exploring the possibility of a a web development career and decided to take on DevLeague with absolutely no experience in coding. The creative outlets of web development inspire me as well as the effect of technology on human behavior. I look forward to using cutting-edge technology to build intriguing and thought-provoking designs while being part of such an innovative and inclusive community.</p>

    <p class="description">Keith Johnson was born in Philadelphia, Pa. He graduated from Rowan University with a Bachelors of music degree in 2013. In 2016, he decided to transition from a career in music performance, to a full-stack developer. He joined the 18th cohort of the Dev League bootcamp to enhance his abilities as a javascript developer. Keith enjoys performing arts and plans to bridge the gap between music, art, and technology.

    <p class="description">After a roundabout journey to web development, from country bumpkin in Louisiana, to aspiring novelist in DC, to starving playwright in New York City, to desperate publishing professional &mdash;  John finally discovered his love for app development working with several of the big publishing houses of New York. He is now settled in to paradise in Oahu, and ready to change the world with his cutting-edge AR skilz. John holds an MFA in Creative Writing, and spent 5 years with the BMI Musical Theater Workshop in New York, neither of which have anything to do with being a dev.</p>

    <p class="description">Oksana's journey to <span class="crossout">what her computer scientist mom has been urging for years </span>  being a dev wound through years of product managing, saving the world through energy efficiency, and photographing actors and models for magazines in NYC. Now, she finally gets to be a professional tinkerer, and just sit there, building pretty things out of pixels. (She loves how much sitting is involved in this profession!) Oksana hopes to take the world by storm with creative ideas that bring art, technology and silliness together into one beautiful non-particularly-sensical expression of the self. Life = function (self) { return express (self); } </p>
