<h1>ABOUT THE ART</h1>
<div>VIDEO WITH SCRUB BAR GOES HERE--STRETCH!!!</div>
<p>VirtuART is our ambitious attempt at uniting communities and their creative endeavors through the cutting edge technology of Aumented Reality.  Our inspiration originally sprouted from an idea of "virtual graffiti" that lives in AR and is contributed to by the community as a whole.  Eventually we would love to see this project manifest into it's own installation at Pow!Wow!, an annual street art festival in Kakaako, during which artists create and present murals on entire sides of buildings.  This project was built in our last two weeks of DevLeague, an intense, 12-week web development bootcamp.  </p>
